            <h3>Project One</h3>
            <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to produce insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Early diagnosis is critical for effective management and prevention of complications. With the advancement of machine learning (ML), it has become possible to predict diabetes based on various clinical features and personal health data. This project report describes the development of a diabetes prediction app using machine learning models.</p>

            <h3>Project Two</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, managing and filtering spam emails has become crucial for both individuals and organizations. Spam emails not only clutter inboxes but also pose security risks. This project aims to develop a spam mail predictor using machine learning techniques in Python. The primary objective is to create a model that can classify emails as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) with high accuracy.</p>
